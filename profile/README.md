# 99Codes

Software engineering and technical consulting focused on reliability, performance, and evolving production systems under real-world constraints.

99Codes is the independent consultancy of **Leonardo Poletto**, a senior software engineer with 10+ years of experience building and maintaining production systems across education, media, marketplaces, and high-traffic platforms.

## What I work on

- **Backend systems & APIs** that must remain stable under real-world constraints  
- **Platform and frontend engineering** where performance, correctness, and maintainability matter  
- **Legacy systems** that need to evolve without breaking production  
- **Short- to mid-term consulting engagements** requiring ownership, clarity, and delivery

---

## Selected work

- Advanced search and data integration using **Elasticsearch** and **BigQuery**  
- Offline-first web platforms for low-connectivity environments (PWA, Service Workers, legacy constraints)  
- Large-scale media pipelines (video ingestion, TTS, async processing, notifications)  
- High-traffic WordPress and Laravel systems with strict performance and availability requirements  
- Experimentation, feature rollouts, and data feedback loops

Most work here reflects **client production systems** and cannot be open-sourced.  
Public repositories are selectively published when appropriate.
