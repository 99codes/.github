# 99Codes

99Codes is a software engineering and technical consulting practice focused on building, maintaining, and evolving production systems under real-world constraints.

I work on backend systems, APIs, and platforms where reliability, performance, and long-term maintainability matter — often inside existing teams, legacy codebases, and high-traffic environments.

This organization hosts selected code, experiments, and tooling related to that work when appropriate.

## What I work on

- Backend systems and APIs that need to remain stable in production  
- Platform and frontend engineering with a strong focus on correctness and performance  
- Legacy systems that need to evolve without breaking what already works  
- Short- to mid-term consulting engagements requiring ownership and technical clarity  

## Philosophy

- Ship systems that survive real usage  
- Prefer boring, proven solutions over unnecessary complexity  
- Optimize for maintainability, not demos  
- Respect constraints: budget, timelines, legacy, people  

## Status

I’m open to full-time roles and selected consulting engagements.
